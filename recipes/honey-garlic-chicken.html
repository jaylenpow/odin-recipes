    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb chicken breast</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat, hold back about 1 tsp for later.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn heat down slightly to medium high.</li>
        <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.</li>
        <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.</li>
        <li>Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.</li>
    </ol>
