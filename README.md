# odin-recipes
For my first project I am going to making a recipe website. I will be making an index page with links yo a few recipes.

During this project I will be using the skills I have learned so far. Using the CLI, Git, Github, and HTML. I have demonstrated how to use the CLI to open this file, and have demonstrated how to use Git to make the file and Github to clone the repository and confirm those actions in the CLI with the Git commands.
